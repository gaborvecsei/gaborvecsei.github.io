<p>I earned my BSc degree from Budapest University of Technology and Economics as a Engineer IT Specialist where I studied and worked with robotics, computer vision and machine learning. Currently I am doing my MSc. I gained experience at a startup company where I worked as a software developer and computer vision specialist. Also I started my own robotics startup RebotKit. Right now I engineer data, build machine learning models, and try to find valuable information in the data as a Data Scientist. Besides the school and work I like to spend time on side projects. I love to play the guitar :guitar:, do arts, travel, skateboard and perform magic tricks.</p>

	<li><i>Ágoston Török - Lead Data Scientist at AGT International</i><p>Gabor is a unique individual because he is able to see the real challenges in complex data science problems. He manages to persevere in the data cleaning, engineering and algorithm optimising tasks even when the tasks are not rewarding in the short term. He is clearly one of the most talented young data scientists I ever interviewed and I was lucky to work with. I can only recommend him to any R&D company.</p></li>
	<li><i>David Ottlik - CEO at Synetiq</i><p>Gábor proved himself as a smart, fast-learning and always curious data scientist. His kind and proactive attitude and practical machine-learning and computer vision experience made him a valuable team member from day one.</p></li>
