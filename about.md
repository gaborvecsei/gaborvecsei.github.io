My name is Gábor Vecsei and I'm the Head of AI at Byborg Enterprises. I scaled our AI organization from 3 to 30+ engineers, building production systems across computer vision, LLMs, and generative AI that power live-streaming platforms.

I was the Co-Founder & CTO of [RebotKit](https://rebotkit.net) (2016-2019), where we created educational robotics kits from recyclable materials and partnered with organizations like Vodafone and Magyar Telekom.

Also...I love chocolate 🍫.
