My name is Gábor Vecsei and I run the Artificial Intelligence team at Docler Holding - With our engineers and researchers we work on novel approaches which can be used in live-streaming applications.

I am the Co-Founder of [RebotKit](https://rebotkit.net) - Our mission is to reform the education and learning with our cost efficient and environmentally friendly robot builder kit where the limit is only our creativity.

Also...I love chocolate 🍫.
