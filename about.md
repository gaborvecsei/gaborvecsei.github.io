<p>I earned my BSc degree from Budapest University of Technology and Economics as a Engineer IT Specialist where I studied and worked with robotics, computer vision and machine learning. Currently I am doing my MSc. I gained experience at a startup company where I worked as a software developer and computer vision specialist. Also I started my own robotics startup RebotKit. Right now I engineer data, build machine learning models, and try to find valuable information in the data as a Data Scientist. Besides the school and work I like to spend time on side projects. I love to play the guitar ðŸŽ¸, do arts, travel, skateboard and perform magic tricks.</p>
