I could always rely on Gábor in everything, and I learned a lot from him, including developing my leadership skills. He is a calm and balanced leader, as well as a supportive workplace friend. I truly hope I’ll have the opportunity to work with him again in the future.</p></li>

He leads by example and he created a positive environment where everyone felt involved and heard. He has great communication skills with the business allowing their needs to be met with great success while giving them a good understanding of our technical constraints. He is forward-thinking and involves himself a lot in finding meaningful ideas where ML can enhance a process in the company. He always chooses architecture and tools adapted to our needs to improve efficiency and minimize the cost. He focused on recruiting smart and good people to create a thriving team.
